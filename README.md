## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Vanilla Javascfript

### What I learned

I learnt how to position elements in a proper way by following closely the designs in the provided files.
I also learnt how to style elements like range input and checkboxes, which are hard to style.

### Continued development

I will work into improving the style of my solution and use it as a base to learn how to write tests and use a frontend framework and a css framework like tailwind as well.
